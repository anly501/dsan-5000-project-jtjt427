In 2019/2020, Australia was struck by a severe bushfire, leading to more than 19 million hectares of land burnt, more than 3,000 homes destroyed and 33 people died [@filkov2020impact]. As a recent study carried out by the University of Maryland, wildfires are currently responsible for an additional 3 million hectares of tree cover loss annually compared to the year 2001. This increase amounts to an area roughly equivalent to the size of Belgium. Remarkably, wildfires have contributed to over a quarter of all tree cover loss observed in the pasttwo decades [@tyukavina2022global]. Wildfires are a significant environmental challenge with far-reaching consequences, impacting ecosystems, human lives, and economies. In contrast to other natural hazards like earthquakes or volcanic eruptions, fire is generally seen as a preventable risk. Therefore, predicting and mitigating wildfires is of paramount importance to reduce their devastating effects. This research aims to explore and contribute to the ongoing efforts to better understand wildfire dynamics and improve predictive models for early detection and mitigation.

## The Importance of Predicting and Mitigating Wildfires

Wildfires pose serious threats to both natural environments and human settlements. They lead to ecological damage, air pollution, loss of biodiversity, and economic costs associated with firefighting efforts and property damage. Wildfire smoke, in particular, comprises a blend of dangerous airborne substances, including PM2.5, NO2, ozone, aromatic hydrocarbons, and lead. Beyond polluting the atmosphere with harmful pollutants, wildfires also have a simultaneous effect on the climate by emitting substantial amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the air [^1]. Reducing the risk of wildfire is crucial for safeguarding our ecosystems, reducing the risk to communities, and managing resources effectively.

## Previous Researches and Points of Views

Multiple reports, spanning from mainstream media to peer-reviewed scientific journals, have fostered a prevailing belief that fires have experienced an escalation or intensification on a global scale in recent years. These reports frequently present quantitative findings, yet they frequently rely on limited timeframes and localized datasets concerning fire occurrence or burned areas. Such narrow perspectives may not accurately capture the broader temporal and spatial complexities of the situation. Previous researches have indeed delved into various facets of wildfires, encompassing their origins, patterns, and the creation of predictive models. They reveals diverse perspectives on wildfire prediction and mitigation. Some researchers emphasize the role of climate change[^2] in exacerbating fire risks, while others focus on the importance of land management practices and early warning systems. There are ongoing debates about the most effective strategies for firefighting and how to balance prevention and response efforts.

## Research Goals

In this study, I aim to address several key questions related to wildfires. Our primary goals are:

- To develop an accurate predictive model for wildfire occurrence and spread.
- To investigate the impact of climate factors, including temperature, humidity, and wind, on wildfire behavior.
- To assess the effectiveness of early warning systems and their integration into wildfire management strategies.
- To examine the economic and ecological costs of wildfires and the potential benefits of proactive mitigation.

## Research Questions

To achieve my research goals, I will address the following questions:

1. **How can historical wildfire and climate data be effectively cleaned and prepared for predictive modeling?**
   - The project demonstrates thorough data cleaning methods, preparing datasets for accurate analysis.

2. **What are the main characteristics and patterns in wildfire data?**
   - Through exploratory data analysis, the project identifies key patterns, anomalies, and insights in wildfire occurrences and their contributing factors.

3. **How can clustering algorithms identify patterns in climate data related to wildfires?**
   - The application of K-Means, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Clustering reveals intrinsic groupings in the data, highlighting environmental conditions that might influence wildfire risks.

4. **Which dimensionality reduction techniques best simplify complex climate data while retaining essential information?**
   - The project utilizes PCA and t-SNE to reduce data complexity, uncovering significant features and non-linear relationships crucial for understanding wildfire occurrences.

5. **How can Decision Trees and Random Forest algorithms be employed to predict wildfires?**
   - The project uses these classification models to analyze climate data and predict high-risk and low-risk days for wildfires, demonstrating their effectiveness in handling such complex prediction tasks.

6. **What impact does dataset imbalance have on classification models in wildfire prediction?**
   - Addressing the challenge of dataset imbalance, the project assesses the impact on model performance, particularly in predicting the less frequent, yet critical, occurrences of wildfires.

7. **How does adjusting hyperparameters in clustering and classification algorithms affect their performance in wildfire prediction?**
   - The project explores the optimization of hyperparameters, such as the silhouette score in clustering and the perplexity in t-SNE, to enhance model accuracy.

8. **Can non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques reveal hidden patterns in wildfire data?**
   - The use of t-SNE demonstrates how non-linear techniques can identify complex patterns not discernible through linear methods like PCA.

9. **How effective are ensemble methods like Random Forests compared to single models like Decision Trees in predicting wildfires?**
   - The project compares these methods, highlighting the increased accuracy and reliability of ensemble methods in handling diverse and complex datasets.

10. **What insights can be gained from visualizing high-dimensional wildfire data in lower-dimensional spaces?**
    - By implementing dimensionality reduction techniques, the project successfully visualizes complex data in a more interpretable form, aiding in the identification of key variables and their relationships.
