## Wildfire Statitics

### Data Source
The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC)[^1], established in 1965, is a pivotal institution in the United States responsible for coordinating and supporting wildfire management, suppression efforts, and wildland fire prevention initiatives. The NIFC's work is of paramount importance in the United States due to the increasing frequency and severity of wildfires. It serves as a critical hub for wildfire information, resource coordination, and expertise, contributing to the safety of communities and the protection of natural resources.

## California 2020 Wildfire Statistics

### Data Source

The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE)[^2] is the primary source of wildfire data for the state of California. CAL FIRE plays a critical role in wildfire management, suppression efforts, and public safety. Their data is essential for understanding and mitigating the impact of wildfires on California's communities and natural resources.

### Gathering Method

To acquire the wildfire data from CAL FIRE, the following steps were taken:

1. **Access Permission**: visited the CAL FIRE website to review their data sharing policies and ensure compliance with their terms of use.

2. **Data Collection**: The datasets were obtained directly from CAL FIRE's data repository. CAL FIRE provides accessible and downloadable data files, making it a valuable resource for wildfire-related information.

3. **Data Storage**: The downloaded data files were securely stored in the project's data repository, ready for further analysis and processing.

### Data Description

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from CAL FIRE and provides information on large wildfires (greater than 400 acres) in California for the year 2020. The dataset includes the following key columns:

- `Incident #`: A unique identifier for each wildfire incident.
- `County`: The county in California where the wildfire occurred.
- `FireName`: The name assigned to the wildfire.
- `StartDate`: The date when the wildfire started.
- `EndDate`: The date when the wildfire was extinguished.
- `Acres Burned`: The total acreage affected by the wildfire.
- `VegType`: The type of vegetation involved in the wildfire.
- `Cause`: The cause of the wildfire.
- `StructureDest.`: The number of structures destroyed due to the wildfire.
- `StructureDam.`: The number of structures damaged due to the wildfire.
- `FirePersonnelDeath`: The number of firefighting personnel deaths associated with the wildfire.
- `CivilDeath`: The number of civilian deaths related to the wildfire.

This dataset provides valuable insights into wildfires in California, including their locations, sizes, causes, and impact on structures and lives. It serves as a fundamental resource for understanding the climate influence on wildfires in California.


## California Weather Data

### Data Source
The weather data for California was obtained from the Visual Crossing Weather API[^3]. Visual Crossing Weather is a weather data service that provides historical weather information, including temperature, precipitation, wind, and other meteorological data. This data source was chosen to gather historical weather data for the analysis of its potential correlation with wildfire incidents.

[^3]: Visual Crossing Weather API - [Link](https://weather.visualcrossing.com)

### Gathering Method

To obtain historical weather data for California, the following steps were followed:

1. **Access Permission**: The Visual Crossing Weather API was accessed to review their data sharing policies and ensure compliance with their terms of use.
2. **Data Retrieval**: A Python script using the `requests` library was utilized to send a GET request to the Visual Crossing Weather API. The API endpoint was configured to retrieve weather data for California for specific date ranges.
3. **Data Conversion**: The API response, received in JSON format, was parsed to extract the weather data. The JSON data was converted into a Pandas DataFrame for easier analysis.
4. **Data Storage**: The resulting weather data for California in each year was stored in separate CSV files. These files were securely saved in the project's data repository for further analysis and integration into the project.

### Data Description

Weather data was gathered for the following years: 2020, 2017, 2015, 2014, 2010, and 2001. The data includes various meteorological parameters for each day in the specified years. Below is a description of the common columns present in the weather datasets, represented here using data from the "Cali_2020.csv" dataset as an example:

- `datetime`: The date of the recorded data.
- `datetimeEpoch`: The Unix epoch timestamp corresponding to the date.
- `tempmax`: The maximum temperature in Celsius for the day.
- `tempmin`: The minimum temperature in Celsius for the day.
- `temp`: The average temperature in Celsius for the day.
- `feelslikemax`: The maximum "feels like" temperature in Celsius for the day.
- `feelslikemin`: The minimum "feels like" temperature in Celsius for the day.
- `feelslike`: The average "feels like" temperature in Celsius for the day.
- `dew`: Dew point temperature in Celsius.
- `humidity`: Relative humidity as a percentage.
- `precip`: Total precipitation in millimeters.
- `precipprob`: Probability of precipitation as a percentage.

The datasets also include additional columns providing information on various weather-related parameters, such as wind speed, cloud cover, and sunrise/sunset times, among others.
