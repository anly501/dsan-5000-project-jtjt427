This suggests that the dataset likely has a similar distribution, with many more days without fires than with.\nProbability of prediction: Approximately 90.4% of the time, the classifier predicts “no fire,” and about 9.6% of the time, it predicts “fire.” This is consistent with the actual distribution of labels in the dataset.\nAccuracy: The accuracy is 81.14%, which seems quite high at first glance. However, this is misleading because if the “no fire” class significantly outnumbers the “fire” class, then a classifier that always predicts “no fire” would also have high accuracy. This is known as the accuracy paradox.\nPrecision, recall, fscore: Precision is around 7.2%, indicating that when the classifier predicts a fire, it’s correct only about 7.2% of the time. Recall is about 6.5%, meaning it correctly identifies 6.5% of the actual fire days. The F1 score, which balances precision and recall, is also low at approximately 7%. These values are much lower than the accuracy, highlighting the issue with imbalanced classes: even with high accuracy, the model’s ability to correctly identify positive instances (fire days) is poor.\n\nIn conclusion, the informed random classifier’s high accuracy is not a good indicator of performance due to class imbalance. The low precision and recall reveal the classifier’s lack of predictive power, as it seldom correctly predicts fire days. This reinforces the need for a more sophisticated model that can handle the imbalance and predict the minority class (fire days) more effectively. These baseline figures set a threshold that any predictive model should aim to exceed, especially in terms of precision and recall, to be genuinely useful for wildfire prediction."

Higher perplexity values consider more neighbors for a broader context.\nIn this case, we will explore the results of t-SNE with different perplexity values (30, 50, 1) in order to see how the data points cluster.\n\n\nCode\nfrom sklearn.manifold import TSNE\n\n\n# DO DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION\nX_embedded = TSNE(n_components=3, learning_rate='auto',init='random', perplexity=30).fit_transform(X)\n\n# EXPLORE RESULTS\nprint(\"RESULTS\") \nprint(\"shape : \",X_embedded.shape)\nprint(\"First few points : \\n\",X_embedded[0:2,:])\n\n# PLOT \nplt.scatter(X_embedded[:,0],X_embedded[:,1], alpha=0.5)\nplt.show()\n\n\nRESULTS\nshape :  (1872, 3)\nFirst few points : \n [[  8.744666    3.138517  -10.389686 ]\n [  4.903321    0.0216501  -6.5611925]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# DO DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION\nX_embedded = TSNE(n_components=3, learning_rate='auto',init='random', perplexity=50).fit_transform(X)\n\n# EXPLORE RESULTS\nprint(\"RESULTS\") \nprint(\"shape : \",X_embedded.shape)\nprint(\"First few points : \\n\",X_embedded[0:2,:])\n\n# PLOT \nplt.scatter(X_embedded[:,0],X_embedded[:,1], alpha=0.5)\nplt.show()\n\n\nRESULTS\nshape :  (1872, 3)\nFirst few points : \n [[ 7.0168204  -2.4403467   9.426487  ]\n [ 5.094756   -0.08218412  5.409552  ]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# DO DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION\nX_embedded = TSNE(n_components=3, learning_rate='auto',init='random', perplexity=1).fit_transform(X)\n\n# EXPLORE RESULTS\nprint(\"RESULTS\") \nprint(\"shape : \",X_embedded.shape)\nprint(\"First few points : \\n\",X_embedded[0:2,:])\n\n# PLOT \nplt.scatter(X_embedded[:,0],X_embedded[:,1], alpha=0.5)\nplt.show()\n\n\nRESULTS\nshape :  (1872, 3)\nFirst few points : \n [[-6.296935  10.623576  27.319828 ]\n [ 5.7153225  1.0619602 15.728415 ]]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe t-SNE visualizations indicated that the dataset contains complex, non-linear relationships.

    "text": "Comparisons and Insights\nComparing PCA and t-SNE, we observed that PCA provided a clearer separation between classes, which might be beneficial for linear predictive modeling. However, t-SNE offered valuable insights into local structures and relationships that are not linearly separable.\nBoth PCA and t-SNE have illuminated aspects of our data that could be crucial for predicting wildfire occurrences. PCA showed a promising direction for feature reduction in predictive modeling, while t-SNE provided a deeper understanding of data structure complexities.\nThe next steps include using the insights from these dimensionality reduction techniques to inform the feature selection for machine learning models aimed at predicting wildfire occurrences. Additionally, we plan to investigate the specific climate features that most strongly predict wildfires, as indicated by their weights in the principal components."

    "text": "Under this tab, our analysis aimed to identify patterns within California’s climate and fire data basing the features containing maximum and minimum temperatures, humidity, precipitation, and wind speed to potentially predict wildfire occurrences. We employed various clustering algorithms, such as K-Means, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Clustering, to segregate the data into meaningful clusters. Clustering can reveal intrinsic groupings that might correlate with environmental conditions conducive to wildfires.\n\n\nK-Means is a method that aims to divide a dataset into ‘k’ distinct, non-overlapping subgroups (or clusters) based on the features of the data. Imagine you have a room full of people and you want to form groups based on their heights and weights. K-Means would find the average height and weight for ‘k’ number of groups and then assign each person to the group they are closest to in terms of those two features. It’s like organizing people into sports teams so that each team has players of similar overall physical attributes.\nFor selecting the right number of clusters, we often use the ‘elbow method’. This involves plotting the number of clusters against the within-cluster variance (how spread out the data is within each cluster) and looking for a point where the decrease in variance slows down significantly, resembling an ‘elbow’. This ‘elbow’ typically indicates a good balance between the number of clusters and the spread of the data within them.\n\n\n\nDBSCAN stands out because it doesn’t require us to specify the number of clusters beforehand. It works by identifying areas of high density and expanding those areas to form clusters. Think of it like a party where groups of people are naturally forming. Some groups are large, some are small, and there are individuals who don’t join any group. DBSCAN can identify all these groups and loners without needing to know how many groups there will be in advance.\nWhen it comes to determining how well DBSCAN has performed, we look at how well the identified clusters match our expectations or known labels (if we have them). There isn’t a one-size-fits-all metric like the elbow method for DBSCAN, but we might use something called the ‘silhouette score’, which measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. The score ranges from -1 to 1, where a high value indicates that the object is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters.\n\n\n\nHierarchical clustering creates a tree of clusters. Imagine you are organizing a large family reunion. You start by pairing up close relatives. Then, these small family groups are gradually brought together into larger and larger extended family groups until everyone is included in the family tree. Hierarchical clustering works similarly with data points, creating a diagram known as a dendrogram that visually represents the data points and their respective similarity levels.\nSelecting the number of clusters in hierarchical clustering can be visualized using a dendrogram, which shows where you can ‘cut’ the tree to form distinct groups. A common method to help decide where to cut is the silhouette score, similar to what’s used in DBSCAN. It gives a sense of how distinct our clusters are and can help us choose an optimal cut-off in the tree that best captures the natural divisions in our data.\nEach of these clustering methods offers a unique way of uncovering patterns and groups within complex datasets, which can be invaluable for making informed decisions based on data.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport sklearn.cluster\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport sklearn\n\n\n\n\nCode\nCA_climate_fire = pd.read_csv('../data/cleaned-data/CA_climate_fire.csv')"

Imagine you have a room full of people and you want to form groups based on their heights and weights. K-Means would find the average height and weight for ‘k’ number of groups and then assign each person to the group they are closest to in terms of those two features. It’s like organizing people into sports teams so that each team has players of similar overall physical attributes.\nFor selecting the right number of clusters, we often use the ‘elbow method’. This involves plotting the number of clusters against the within-cluster variance (how spread out the data is within each cluster) and looking for a point where the decrease in variance slows down significantly, resembling an ‘elbow’. This ‘elbow’ typically indicates a good balance between the number of clusters and the spread of the data within them.\n\n\n\nDBSCAN stands out because it doesn’t require us to specify the number of clusters beforehand. It works by identifying areas of high density and expanding those areas to form clusters. Think of it like a party where groups of people are naturally forming. Some groups are large, some are small, and there are individuals who don’t join any group. DBSCAN can identify all these groups and loners without needing to know how many groups there will be in advance.\nWhen it comes to determining how well DBSCAN has performed, we look at how well the identified clusters match our expectations or known labels (if we have them). There isn’t a one-size-fits-all metric like the elbow method for DBSCAN, but we might use something called the ‘silhouette score’, which measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. The score ranges from -1 to 1, where a high value indicates that the object is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters.\n\n\n\nHierarchical clustering creates a tree of clusters. Imagine you are organizing a large family reunion. You start by pairing up close relatives. Then, these small family groups are gradually brought together into larger and larger extended family groups until everyone is included in the family tree. Hierarchical clustering works similarly with data points, creating a diagram known as a dendrogram that visually represents the data points and their respective similarity levels.\nSelecting the number of clusters in hierarchical clustering can be visualized using a dendrogram, which shows where you can ‘cut’ the tree to form distinct groups. A common method to help decide where to cut is the silhouette score, similar to what’s used in DBSCAN. It gives a sense of how distinct our clusters are and can help us choose an optimal cut-off in the tree that best captures the natural divisions in our data.\nEach of these clustering methods offers a unique way of uncovering patterns and groups within complex datasets, which can be invaluable for making informed decisions based on data.\n\n\nCode\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport sklearn.cluster\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport sklearn\n\n\n\n\nCode\nCA_climate_fire = pd.read_csv('../data/cleaned-data/CA_climate_fire.csv')"

    "text": "Australia Bushfire\nIn 2019/2020, Australia was struck by a severe bushfire, leading to more than 19 million hectares of land burnt, more than 3,000 homes destroyed and 33 people died (Filkov et al. 2020). As a recent study carried out by the University of Maryland, wildfires are currently responsible for an additional 3 million hectares of tree cover loss annually compared to the year 2001. This increase amounts to an area roughly equivalent to the size of Belgium. Remarkably, wildfires have contributed to over a quarter of all tree cover loss observed in the pasttwo decades (Tyukavina et al. 2022). Wildfires are a significant environmental challenge with far-reaching consequences, impacting ecosystems, human lives, and economies. In contrast to other natural hazards like earthquakes or volcanic eruptions, fire is generally seen as a preventable risk. Therefore, predicting and mitigating wildfires is of paramount importance to reduce their devastating effects. This research aims to explore and contribute to the ongoing efforts to better understand wildfire dynamics and improve predictive models for early detection and mitigation."

    "text": "The Importance of Predicting and Mitigating Wildfires\nWildfires pose serious threats to both natural environments and human settlements. They lead to ecological damage, air pollution, loss of biodiversity, and economic costs associated with firefighting efforts and property damage. Wildfire smoke, in particular, comprises a blend of dangerous airborne substances, including PM2.5, NO2, ozone, aromatic hydrocarbons, and lead. Beyond polluting the atmosphere with harmful pollutants, wildfires also have a simultaneous effect on the climate by emitting substantial amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the air 1. Reducing the risk of wildfire is crucial for safeguarding our ecosystems, reducing the risk to communities, and managing resources effectively."

    "text": "Previous Researches and Points of Views\nMultiple reports, spanning from mainstream media to peer-reviewed scientific journals, have fostered a prevailing belief that fires have experienced an escalation or intensification on a global scale in recent years. These reports frequently present quantitative findings, yet they frequently rely on limited timeframes and localized datasets concerning fire occurrence or burned areas. Such narrow perspectives may not accurately capture the broader temporal and spatial complexities of the situation. Previous researches have indeed delved into various facets of wildfires, encompassing their origins, patterns, and the creation of predictive models. They reveals diverse perspectives on wildfire prediction and mitigation. Some researchers emphasize the role of climate change2 in exacerbating fire risks, while others focus on the importance of land management practices and early warning systems. There are ongoing debates about the most effective strategies for firefighting and how to balance prevention and response efforts."

Our goal is to: 1. prepare these datasets for analysis against the SuppCosts dataset on the effects of precipitation on wildfire occurance throughout the years 2. integrate weather datasets and wildfire datasets with respect to year, in order to facilitate the future analysis on climate effects on wildfires in California.\nSince the climate datasets for different years have the same exact data structure, we will use the California climate data in year 2020 to demonstrate the cleaning process.\n\nData Loading\nWe begin by loading multiple raw datasets, each containing climate data for different years. The datasets include information such as datetime, tempmax, tempmin, humidity, precip, and windspeed:\n\nCali_2020 &lt;- read_csv(\"../data/raw-data/Cali_2020.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE)\n\n\nhead(Cali_2020)\n\n\nA tibble: 6 x 37\n\n\ndatetime\ndatetimeEpoch\ntempmax\ntempmin\ntemp\nfeelslikemax\nfeelslikemin\nfeelslike\ndew\nhumidity\n...\nsunset\nsunsetEpoch\nmoonphase\nconditions\ndescription\nicon\nstations\nsource\ntzoffset\nevents\n\n\n&lt;date&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n...\n&lt;time&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;chr&gt;\n&lt;chr&gt;\n&lt;chr&gt;\n&lt;chr&gt;\n&lt;chr&gt;\n&lt;dbl&gt;\n&lt;chr&gt;\n\n\n\n\n2020-01-01\n1577865600\n14.3\n5.4\n9.0\n14.3\n4.7\n8.7\n6.7\n85.7\n...\n16:55:17\n1577926517\n0.21\nPartially cloudy\nBecoming cloudy in the afternoon.\npartly-cloudy-day\n['KSMF', 'TS389', '72483023232', '72483993225', '72483323206', 'AN063', 'KSAC']\nobs\nNA\nNA\n\n\n2020-01-02\n1577952000\n17.0\n4.2\n9.1\n17.0\n2.5\n8.5\n5.0\n78.1\n...\n16:56:06\n1578012966\n0.25\nPartially cloudy\nPartly cloudy throughout the day.\npartly-cloudy-day\n['KSMF', 'TS388', 'TS389', '72483023232', '72483993225', 'AN063', '72483323206', 'KSAC', '72057600174']\nobs\nNA\nNA\n\n\n2020-01-03\n1578038400\n15.0\n3.8\n8.9\n15.0\n3.8\n8.7\n6.0\n83.0\n...\n16:56:57\n1578099417\n0.28\nClear\nClear conditions throughout the day.\nclear-day\n['KSMF', 'TS389', '72483023232', '72483993225', 'AN063', '72483323206', 'KSAC']\nobs\nNA\nNA\n\n\n2020-01-04\n1578124800\n13.6\n5.7\n9.3\n13.6\n2.8\n8.5\n7.6\n89.6\n...\n16:57:48\n1578185868\n0.31\nRain, Partially cloudy\nPartly cloudy throughout the day with morning rain.\nrain\n['KSMF', 'TS389', '72483023232', '72483993225', 'AN063', '72483323206', 'KSAC', '72057600174']\nobs\nNA\nNA\n\n\n2020-01-05\n1578211200\n15.1\n3.2\n8.4\n15.1\n1.2\n7.8\n4.9\n80.9\n...\n16:58:41\n1578272321\n0.34\nPartially cloudy\nClearing in the afternoon.\npartly-cloudy-day\n['KSMF', 'TS389', '72483023232', '72483993225', '72483323206', 'AN063', 'KSAC']\nobs\nNA\nNA\n\n\n2020-01-06\n1578297600\n13.3\n3.0\n7.6\n13.3\n2.3\n6.8\n2.9\n73.8\n...\n16:59:36\n1578358776\n0.37\nClear\nClear conditions throughout the day.\nclear-day\n['KSMF', 'TS389', '72483023232', '72483993225', '72483323206', 'AN063', 'KSAC', '72057600174']\nobs\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubset Columns\nColumn Selection: we select a subset of columns, including datetime, tempmax, tempmin, humidity, precip, and windspeed.

functions are used:\n\nString Cleaning: A custom function, string_cleaner, is applied to clean and normalize text data. This function handles punctuation, whitespace, character replacements, and converts text to lowercase:\n\n\nverbose=True\n\ndef string_cleaner(input_string):\n    out = ''\n    try: \n        out=re.sub(r\"\"\"\n                    [,.;@#?!&$-]+  # Accept one or more copies of punctuation\n                    \\ *           # plus zero or more copies of a space,\n                    \"\"\",\n                    \" \",          # and replace it with a single space\n                    input_string, flags=re.VERBOSE)\n\n        #REPLACE SELECT CHARACTERS WITH NOTHING\n        out = re.sub('[’.]+', '', input_string)\n\n        #ELIMINATE DUPLICATE WHITESPACES USING WILDCARDS\n        out = re.sub(r'\\s+', ' ', out)\n\n        #CONVERT TO LOWER CASE\n        out=out.lower()\n    except:\n        print(\"ERROR\")\n        out=''\n    return out\n\n\n\nCleaning Process\nThe cleaning process proceeds as follows:\n\nColumn Selection: A subset of relevant columns is selected for further processing, including “source,” “author,” “title,” “description,” “content,” and “publishedAt.”\nAuthor and Source Handling: An error check is performed to ensure that the “author” is not mistakenly the same as the “source.”\nDate Validation: A regular expression is used to validate the date format in the “publishedAt” column.\n\n\narticle_keys = articles.columns\nprint(\"AVAILABLE KEYS:\")\nprint(article_keys)\n\nindex = 0\ncleaned_data = []\n\nfor _, article in articles.iterrows():\n    tmp = []\n    if verbose:\n        print(\"#------------------------------------------\")\n        print(\"#\", index)\n        print(\"#------------------------------------------\")\n\n    for key in article_keys:\n        if verbose:\n            print(\"----------------\")\n            print(key)\n            print(article[key])  # Access the value directly\n\n        if key == 'source':\n            src = string_cleaner(article['source']['name'])\n            tmp.append(src)\n\n        if key == 'author':\n            author = string_cleaner(article['author'])\n            # ERROR CHECK (SOMETIMES AUTHOR IS SAME AS PUBLICATION)\n            if src in author:\n                print(\" AUTHOR ERROR:\", author)\n                author = 'NA'\n            tmp.append(author)\n\n        if key == 'title':\n            tmp.append(string_cleaner(article['title']))\n\n        if key == 'description':\n            tmp.append(string_cleaner(article['description']))\n\n        if key == 'content':\n            tmp.append(string_cleaner(article['content']))\n\n        if key == 'publishedAt':\n            # DEFINE DATA PATTERN FOR RE TO CHECK  .* --&gt; wildcard\n            ref = re.compile('.*-.*-.*T.*:.*:.*Z')\n            date = article['publishedAt']\n            if not ref.match(date):\n                print(\" DATE ERROR:\", date)\n                date = \"NA\"\n            tmp.append(date)\n\n    cleaned_data.append(tmp)\n    index += 1\n\nAVAILABLE KEYS:\nIndex(['source', 'author', 'title', 'description', 'url', 'urlToImage',\n       'publishedAt', 'content'],\n      dtype='object')\n#------------------------------------------\n# 0\n#------------------------------------------\n----------------\nsource\n{'id': 'bbc-news', 'name': 'BBC News'}\n----------------\nauthor\nhttps://www.facebook.com/bbcnews\n----------------\ntitle\nVoice referendum: Lies fuel racism ahead of Australia's Indigenous vote\n----------------\ndescription\nExperts express concerns for First Nations people as a referendum debate turns increasingly divisive.\n----------------\nurl\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-66470376\n----------------\nurlToImage\nhttps://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13D39/production/_130790218_gettyimages-1593394059-1.jpg\n----------------\npublishedAt\n2023-09-05T21:23:49Z\n----------------\ncontent\n\"People have been let off the leash,\" Thomas Mayo says quietly, swiping through screenshots. \nRacist memes depicting First Nations Australians as \"grifters\", \"wife beaters\" and \"primitives\" flash ac… [+9064 chars]\n#------------------------------------------\n# 1\n#------------------------------------------\n----------------\nsource\n{'name': 'Scientific American'}\n----------------\nauthor\nCurtis Abraham\n----------------\ntitle\nLarge Herbivores Can Help Prevent Massive Wildfires\n----------------\ndescription\nReintroducing large herbivores into fire-prone areas can help combat the global rise in megafires\n----------------\nurl\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/large-herbivores-can-help-prevent-massive-wildfires/\n----------------\nurlToImage\nhttps://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/cache/file/61CB9CDD-6C92-43FF-97517A08D9369F51.jpg\n----------------\npublishedAt\n2023-09-09T12:00:00Z\n----------------\ncontent\nIn 2019 and 2020, a megafire scorched eastern Australia, destroying some 24 million hectares of land, and adding to the hole in the ozone layer.

    "text": "The project encapsulates a comprehensive data science project aimed at predicting and mitigating wildfires, a pressing environmental challenge. Through an integration of various data science techniques, the project provides an insightful model for addressing complex natural phenomena and demonstrates the impactful role of data science in environmental management and disaster prevention.\n\nData Gathering and Cleaning\nAt the foundation of the project lies a thorough data gathering process. Data is sourced from authoritative entities like the National Interagency Fire Center, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, and Visual Crossing Weather API. This ensures the project is built on a diverse and reliable dataset, encompassing wildfire statistics, climate variables, and news articles relevant to wildfire prevention. The meticulous data cleaning process that follows sets a strong groundwork for the analysis, ensuring data integrity and quality. This phase underscores the importance of preparing accurate and representative datasets, as the quality of data directly influences the efficacy of predictive models.\n\n\nData Exploration\nThe data exploration stage is a deep dive into the datasets, aiming to understand their characteristics, identify patterns, and detect anomalies. Techniques such as visualization, correlation analysis, and outlier detection are adeptly used to uncover insights into wildfire trends. This phase not only highlights the distribution and relationships between variables but also fosters a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing wildfire occurrences.\nClustering Analysis\nIn the clustering phase, the project employs algorithms like K-Means, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Clustering to discover inherent groupings in the data. This analysis is pivotal in identifying environmental conditions that may be conducive to wildfires. The use of the silhouette score to determine the optimal clustering parameters showcases a thoughtful approach to model tuning, balancing mathematical rigor with practical applicability.\n\n\nDimensionality Reduction\nThe dimensionality reduction segment, utilizing PCA and t-SNE, addresses the complexities and high-dimensionality of the data. PCA simplifies the dataset by focusing on components that capture the maximum variance, while t-SNE, a non-linear technique, reveals intricate non-linear relationships. This phase enhances the dataset’s manageability and helps in unveiling hidden patterns, which are critical for understanding and predicting wildfire occurrences.\n\n\nDecision Tree and Classification Analysis\nThe decision tree and random forest classification models mark the culmination of the project. These models are ingeniously used to classify and predict wildfire occurrences. The decision tree approach, akin to a systematic decision-making process, and the random forest method, which aggregates multiple decision trees, demonstrate a nuanced understanding of classification problems. The project thoughtfully addresses the challenge of dataset imbalance, emphasizing the importance of precision, recall, and confusion matrix metrics, ensuring the models’ effectiveness in real-world scenarios.\n\n\nComprehensive Integration and Implications\nThe website presents a model project where data science is seamlessly integrated to address a critical environmental issue. The project exemplifies how data gathering, cleaning, exploration, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and classification can be cohesively combined to provide meaningful insights into a complex issue like wildfire prediction and mitigation.\nThis project stands as a testament to the potential of data science in societal advancement. It transcends technical prowess, delving into the practical implications of predictive modeling in disaster management. The project’s comprehensive approach provides a blueprint for utilizing data science in environmental conservation efforts and highlights the discipline’s significance in addressing global challenges.\nIn conclusion, the project not only showcases a technically robust data science project but also underscores the profound impact such endeavors can have on society. It exemplifies how data science, when applied thoughtfully and rigorously, can contribute significantly to understanding and solving real-world problems. The project, with its thorough methodology and practical orientation, serves as an inspiring example for future data science projects aimed at societal and environmental betterment."

Each column and its associated datatype are:\n\nYear: Int64 - This represents the year of the data entry.\nCause: Object - This signifies the cause of the wildfire, either “Human” or “Lightning.”\nCali_Acres: Int64 - The number of acres affected by wildfires in California for the given year and cause.\nTotal_Acres: Int64 - The total acres affected by wildfires across the US for the given year and cause.\nCali_Fires: Int64 - The number of fire incidents in California for the given year and cause.\nTotal_Fires: Int64 - The total number of fire incidents across the US for the given year and cause.\n\nKey insights:\n\nThe dataset spans from the year 2001 to 2020.\nOn average, California sees wildfires covering an area of approximately 413,923 acres per year.\nIn terms of fire incidents, California has an average of around 4,261 fires annually.\nThe entire US, including California, witnesses wildfires covering around 3.46 million acres and approximately 34,830 fire incidents each year.\n\nWith this foundational understanding, we are now better equipped to dive deeper into the dataset and uncover more patterns and insights during our exploratory data analysis.\n\n\nData Visualiztions\nNow, let’s create visualizations to explore the data distribution and relationships.\n\n\nCode\n# Data Visualization\n\n# Histogram \n# Set up a 2x2 grid of plots\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(12, 8))\n\n# Plot 1: Total Fires\nsns.histplot(data=Human_Lightening, x='Total_Fires', hue='Cause', bins=20, kde=True, ax=axes[0, 0])\naxes[0, 0].set_xlabel('Total Wildires')\naxes[0, 0].set_ylabel('Frequency')\naxes[0, 0].set_title('Distribution of Total Wildires')\n\n# Plot 2: Total Acres\nsns.histplot(data=Human_Lightening, x='Total_Acres', hue='Cause', bins=20, kde=True, ax=axes[0, 1])\naxes[0, 1].set_xlabel('Total Acres')\naxes[0, 1].set_ylabel('Frequency')\naxes[0, 1].set_title('Distribution of Total Wildfire Acres')\n\n# Plot 3: California Wildfire Fires\nsns.histplot(data=Human_Lightening, x='Cali_Fires', hue='Cause', bins=20, kde=True, ax=axes[1, 0])\naxes[1, 0].set_xlabel('California Wildfires')\naxes[1, 0].set_ylabel('Frequency')\naxes[1, 0].set_title('Distribution of California Wildfires')\n\n# Plot 4: California Wildfire Acres\nsns.histplot(data=Human_Lightening, x='Cali_Acres', hue='Cause', bins=20, kde=True, ax=axes[1, 1])\naxes[1, 1].set_xlabel('California Wildfire Acres')\naxes[1, 1].set_ylabel('Frequency')\naxes[1, 1].set_title('Distribution of California Wildfire Acres')\n\n# Adjust layout\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n# Show the subplots\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the histograms:\n\nThe first histogram (Distribution of Total Wildires) shows a higher frequency of wildfires caused by humans than by lightning, especially in the lower range. The lightning-caused wildfires seem to have a broader distribution.\nThe second histogram (Distribution of Total Wildfire Acres) reveals that while human-caused wildfires are more frequent, wildfires caused by lightning tend to affect a broader range of acreage.\nThe third histogram (Distribution of California Wildfires) indicates a stark contrast: a significantly higher number of wildfires caused by humans, but the range of wildfires caused by lightning is again broader.\nThe last histogram (Distribution of California Wildfire Acres) shows a similar trend where human-caused wildfires dominate in frequency, but lightning-caused wildfires can impact larger areas.\n\nThis analysis suggests that while human activities might lead to a more significant number of fires, the fires caused by lightning have the potential to be more widespread, affecting larger areas.\n\n\nCorrelation Analysis\nCorrelation analysis is crucial for understanding relationships between variables. It quantifies the degree to which two variables move in relation to each other, offering insights into potential causality, co-occurrences, or underlying patterns. Properly identifying and interpreting correlations aids in hypothesis testing, prediction, and informed decision-making in machine learning process. Now, let’s look at the correlation between variables in the dataset.\n\n\nCode\n# Correlation Analysis\n# Calculate and visualize correlations between numerical variables\nnumeric_columns = Human_Lightening.select_dtypes(include=['float64', 'int64'])\ncorrelation_matrix = numeric_columns.corr()\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', fmt=\".2f\")\nplt.title('Correlation Matrix')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nThe correlation matrix visualizes the strength and direction of linear relationships between various wildfire-related metrics. Observations from the heatmap include:\n\nYear and Cali_Acres: A positive correlation (0.38) indicates that as the year progresses, the acres affected in California due to fires tend to increase. It could suggest that over the years, fires in California have become more widespread in terms of area.\nTotal_Acres and Cali_Fires: The negative correlation (-0.33) might suggest that even if the total number of fires in California increases, the total acres affected on a larger scale may not necessarily increase proportionally.\nCali_Fires and Total_Fires: A very high positive correlation (0.92) shows that when the number of fires in California increases, the total number of fires (perhaps nationwide or in a larger region) also tends to increase significantly. This indicates that California’s fire incidents contribute a substantial proportion to the total fire incidents in the considered region.\nTotal_Acres and Total_Fires: A negative correlation (-0.28) can imply that an increase in the total number of fires doesn’t necessarily equate to a significant increase in the total area affected by those fires.\nYear and Total_Fires: A slightly negative correlation (-0.12) indicates a very weak decreasing trend in the total fires with the progression of years. This suggests that over time, there may be a minor decrease in the total number of fires, but the correlation is so weak that it might not be statistically significant.\n\nIt’s essential to understand that correlation does not imply causation. These are merely relationships and trends in the data, and to draw definitive conclusions, a more in-depth analysis or study would be necessary.\n\n\nOutliers Detection\nOutliers can skew statistical measures, lead to incorrect conclusions, and adversely affect predictive models. Identifying outliers helps ensure data quality, improve model performance, and uncover anomalies or unique insights that might be crucial for understanding underlying phenomena.\n\n\nCode\n# Identifying Outliers\n\n# Set up a 2x2 grid of plots\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(12, 8))\n\n# Total_Fires Boxplot\nsns.boxplot(\n    data=Human_Lightening,\n    x='Total_Fires', \n    hue='Cause',\n    ax=axes[0, 0]\n)\naxes[0, 0].set_title('Total Fires')\n\n# Total_Acres Boxplot\nsns.boxplot(\n    data=Human_Lightening,\n    x='Total_Acres', \n    hue='Cause',\n    ax=axes[0, 1]\n)\naxes[0, 1].set_title('Total Acres')\n\n# Cali_Acres Boxplot\nsns.boxplot(\n    data=Human_Lightening,\n    x='Cali_Acres', \n    hue='Cause',\n    ax=axes[1, 0]\n)\naxes[1, 0].set_title('Cali Acres')\n\n# Cali_Fires Boxplot\nsns.boxplot(\n    data=Human_Lightening,\n    x='Cali_Fires', \n    hue='Cause',\n    ax=axes[1, 1]\n)\naxes[1, 1].set_title('Cali Fires')\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plots depict boxplots comparing two causes of fires: Human and Lightning. These are segmented across four different measures: Total Fires, Total Acres, Cali Acres, and Cali Fires. Let’s break down the observations for each:\n\nTotal Fires:\n\nHuman: The median seems to be around 20,000 with a large interquartile range. This suggests that the number of fires caused by humans is spread out across a broad spectrum.\nLightning: The median for lightning-caused fires is higher, roughly around 65,000. The interquartile range is relatively tighter, which suggests that the number of fires caused by lightning tends to cluster around this median value.\n\nTotal Acres:\n\nHuman: The median number of acres affected by human-caused fires appears to be just over 2 million. The interquartile range seems broader, indicating variability in the data.\nLightning: The median value is closer to 4 million acres. Lightning-caused fires affect a larger median area than those caused by humans.\n\nCali Acres:\n\nHuman: The median for acres affected in California due to human-caused fires seems to be just over 0.5 million. There’s an outlier observed in this data set that’s beyond the maximum whisker.\nLightning: The median is slightly higher, around 0.75 million acres. Like the human-caused data, there’s also an outlier beyond the maximum whisker.\n\nCali Fires:\n\nHuman: The median number of fires in California caused by humans is around 4,000. The interquartile range is relatively tight, but there is an outlier observed.\nLightning: The median is around 5,000 fires, slightly higher than human-caused fires. The spread of data is more consistent with no outliers observed.\n\n\nKey Insights:\n\nFrequency: Lightning seems to cause more fires than humans based on the median values of the ‘Total Fires’ and ‘Cali Fires’ plots.\nImpact: In terms of acres affected, lightning-caused fires seem to have a more significant impact than those caused by humans, both in total acres and specifically in California.\nConsistency: The range of data for lightning-caused fires tends to be more consistent (tighter interquartile ranges), especially for the ‘Total Fires’ data. This suggests that while the frequency and impact of lightning-caused fires can be high, it’s more predictable than human-caused fires.\nOutliers: There are outliers in the data, especially for human-caused fires in the ‘Cali Acres’ and ‘Cali Fires’ plots. These outliers may need to be investigated further to understand any anomalies or specific events leading to these data points."

Each column and its associated datatype are:\n\ndatetime: Object - Represents the date and time of the data entry.\ntempmax: Float64 - The maximum temperature recorded.\ntempmin: Float64 - The minimum temperature recorded.\nhumidity: Float64 - The recorded humidity percentage.\nprecip: Float64 - The precipitation amount.\nwindspeed: Float64 - The wind speed.\nAcresBurned: Float64 - The number of acres affected by wildfires.\nCause: Object - The cause of the wildfire.\nFatalities: Float64 - The number of fatalities due to the wildfire.\nStructureDam: Float64 - Number of structures damaged due to the wildfire.\nfire: Object - Specifies whether there was a fire or not.\nStructureDest.: Float64 - Number of structures destroyed due to the wildfire.\nStructureDam.: Float64 - Another column for the number of structures damaged.\nFirePersonnelDeath: Float64 - The number of fire personnel deaths due to the wildfire.\nCivilDeath: Float64 - The number of civilian deaths due to the wildfire.\n\nKey insights:\n\nThe weather records span 1,872 entries, with average temperatures ranging from around 10.57°C (minimum) to 24.23°C (maximum).\nAverage humidity across the dataset is approximately 63.17%.\nPrecipitation is usually minimal, with a mean value of just over 1mm. The max precipitation recorded is 56.737mm.\nAverage wind speed across the dataset is approximately 18.64 km/h.\nOut of the 1,872 entries, only 199 have recorded data for acres burned, fatalities, and structures damaged. This indicates that many days didn’t witness any fire incidents, or such data might be missing.\nThe average size of wildfires, for the days when they occurred, is approximately 13,029 acres, with the largest fire consuming a vast 396,625 acres.\nThe average fatalities due to wildfires on the days they occurred is 0.33. However, there has been a day with as many as 22 deaths.\nThere’s a notable discrepancy in data availability for the columns StructureDest., StructureDam., FirePersonnelDeath, and CivilDeath with only 66 non-null values each. This suggests that detailed data regarding structures and deaths are available only for a subset of the fire incidents.\nOn the days with data available, an average of around 160.53 structures were destroyed by wildfires, with a peak of 5,636 structures destroyed on a particularly severe day.\n\nThese statistics provide a broad overview of the data. To obtain a more detailed understanding, further exploratory data analysis can be conducted, especially focusing on correlating weather patterns with fire occurrences and severity.\n\n\nCorrelation Analysis\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate the correlation matrix\n\n# Create a mapping for \"Yes\" and \"No\" to 1 and 0\nfire_mapping = {\"Yes\": 1, \"No\": 0}\n\n# Apply the mapping to the \"fire\" column\nCA_climate_fire[\"fire\"] = CA_climate_fire[\"fire\"].map(fire_mapping)\ncorrelation_matrix = CA_climate_fire[['tempmax', 'tempmin', 'humidity', 'precip', 'windspeed', 'fire']].corr()\n\n# Create a heatmap to visualize correlations\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))\nsns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', linewidths=.5)\nplt.title('Variable Correlation Heatmap')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntempmax and tempmin: There’s a strong positive correlation of 0.82 between maximum temperature and minimum temperature. This indicates that when the maximum temperature for a day is high, the minimum temperature is also likely to be high.\ntempmax and humidity: The correlation is -0.77, indicating a strong negative relationship. As the maximum temperature increases, the humidity tends to decrease, suggesting dryer conditions during hotter days.\ntempmin and humidity: With a correlation of -0.52, there’s a moderate negative relationship. This implies that as the minimum temperature increases, the humidity might decrease, but not as strongly as with maximum temperature.\nhumidity and precip: A positive correlation of 0.33 suggests that when humidity is high, there is a higher chance of precipitation.\nwindspeed and precip: They have a positive correlation of 0.26, indicating a weak relationship between wind speed and the likelihood of precipitation.\ntempmax, tempmin and fire: A positive correlation of 0.33 and 0.31 show that as the maximum/minimum temperature increases, the chances or intensity of fires may also increase, suggesting that hotter days might be more prone to fires.\n\nIt’s worth noting that while these correlations provide insights into the relationships between the variables, they don’t establish causation. Further investigation and analysis would be required to determine causative factors.\n\n\nBoxplot on Weather Patterns and Wildfire Occurrences\n\n\nCode\n# Boxplots\nfire_cols = ['tempmax', 'tempmin', 'humidity', 'precip', 'windspeed']\nplt.figure(figsize=(15,8))\n\nfor index, column in enumerate(fire_cols, 1):\n    plt.subplot(2, 3, index)\n    sns.boxplot(y=CA_climate_fire[column][CA_climate_fire['AcresBurned'].notna()])\n    plt.title(f'Distribution of {column} on Days with Fires')\n    plt.ylabel(column)\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntempmax on Days with Fires:\n\nThe majority of days with fires have maximum temperatures ranging roughly between 25°C to 35°C.\nThere are a couple of outlier days with temperatures below 20°C.\n\ntempmin on Days with Fires:\n\nMinimum temperatures on days with fires predominantly fall between approximately 10°C to 20°C.\nThere are some outliers, with a few days having temperatures below 10°C.\n\nhumidity on Days with Fires:\n\nThe humidity levels on days with fires generally range from around 40% to 70%.\nThere’s an outlier with a day having a humidity level close to 90%.\n\nprecipon Days with Fires:\n\nMost days with fires have very little to no precipitation, with the main cluster close to 0. However, there are some days (outliers) where the precipitation is between 5mm to 30mm.\n\nwindspeed on Days with Fires:\n\nWind speeds on days with fires typically vary between roughly 15 to 30 km/h.\nThere are a few outliers, with some days experiencing wind speeds above 35 km/h.\n\n\nIn summary, fires tend to occur on days with temperatures between 10°C and 35°C, humidity levels between 40% and 70%, and wind speeds between 15 to 30 km/h. Precipitation is usually low on these days, though there are exceptions.\n\n\nViolin Plot on TempMax and TempMin\nFrom the visualizations above, tempmax and tempmin seem to be important predictors of wildfire occurence. Let’s draw a violin graph to see the distribution and density of these temperatures on days with and without fires, which might give us more insights into their relationship with wildfire events.\n\n\nCode\n# Set up the figure and subplots\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(20, 6))\nfig.suptitle('Distribution of Temperatures by Fire Occurrence')\n\n# Plot Max Temperature by Fire Occurrence\nsns.violinplot(data=CA_climate_fire, x='fire', y='tempmax', ax=axes[0])\naxes[0].set_title('Distribution of Max Temperature')\n\n# Plot Min Temperature by Fire Occurrence\nsns.violinplot(data=CA_climate_fire, x='fire', y='tempmin', ax=axes[1])\naxes[1].set_title('Distribution of Min Temperature')\n\n# Adjust layout for better appearance\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.subplots_adjust(top=0.85)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMax Temperature (tempmax) Distribution:\n\nOn days without fires (labeled “No”): The distribution is more spread out, with a majority of the days experiencing temperatures between roughly 20°C and 35°C.\nOn days with fires (labeled “Yes”): The temperature distribution is narrower and more concentrated around the median, with most days having temperatures between approximately 25°C and 35°C.\n\nMin Temperature (tempmin) Distribution:\n\nOn days without fires: The temperature mostly ranges from 5°C to 20°C, with a median around 10°C.\nOn days with fires: The distribution is slightly shifted towards higher temperatures, with most days ranging from 10°C to 25°C and a median around 15°C.\n\n\nOverall, it seems that higher max and min temperatures are slightly more associated with days when fires occur. The violin plots reveal that on days with fires, both max and min temperatures tend to be on the higher side."

It has some missing values, indicating certain articles might be anonymous or not attributed to a specific author.\ntitle: Object - The title or headline of the article.\ndescription: Object - A brief summary or description of the article’s content.\ndate: Object - The date when the article was published.\ncontent: Object - The main body or content of the article.\nneg: Float64 - A score representing the negative sentiment present in the article.\nneu: Float64 - A score capturing the neutral sentiment of the article.\npos: Float64 - Represents the positive sentiment score of the article.\ncompound: Float64 - A cumulative sentiment score calculated from the neg, neu, and pos columns.\n\nKey Insights:\n\nThe dataset capture articles on wildfire preventions from various sources and authors.\nSentiment scores (negative, neutral, positive, and compound) are calculated for each article, giving insights into the overall sentiment portrayed in the content.\n\nWith this foundational understanding in place, we can now delve deeper into the dataset to extract meaningful patterns and insights as we proceed with our EDA.\n\n\nData Visualization\n\n\nCode\n# Data Visualization\n# Create histograms for sentiment scores\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\nplt.subplot(2, 2, 1)\nsns.histplot(articles_with_sentiment['neg'], bins=20, kde=True)\nplt.title('Negative Sentiment Distribution')\n\nplt.subplot(2, 2, 2)\nsns.histplot(articles_with_sentiment['neu'], bins=20, kde=True)\nplt.title('Neutral Sentiment Distribution')\n\nplt.subplot(2, 2, 3)\nsns.histplot(articles_with_sentiment['pos'], bins=20, kde=True)\nplt.title('Positive Sentiment Distribution')\n\nplt.subplot(2, 2, 4)\nsns.histplot(articles_with_sentiment['compound'], bins=20, kde=True)\nplt.title('Compound Sentiment Distribution')\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNegative Sentiment Distribution:\n\nThe vast majority of articles have a very low negative sentiment, clustering around the 0.00 to 0.05 range.\nAs the negative sentiment score increases beyond 0.05, the number of articles decreases significantly, suggesting that overtly negative articles are less frequent in this dataset.\n\nNeutral Sentiment Distribution:\n\nThere’s a notable concentration of articles with high neutral scores, particularly between 0.90 and 1.00.\nHowever, there’s also a consistent distribution of articles having neutral scores ranging from 0.60 to 0.90, showing a diverse range of neutrality in the articles.\n\nPositive Sentiment Distribution:\n\nSimilar to the negative sentiment distribution, a significant portion of articles is clustered around the 0.00 to 0.05 range, indicating low positive sentiment.\nThere’s a gradual decline in the number of articles as the positive sentiment score increases.\n\nCompound Sentiment Distribution:\n\nThe compound score, which aggregates the positive, negative, and neutral scores, shows a prominent peak around the 0.00 mark. This suggests that a notable portion of articles has a balanced sentiment.\nThe distribution is somewhat symmetrical on either side of this peak, with articles spread out between strongly negative (-1.00) and strongly positive (1.00) sentiments.\nIt’s worth noting the presence of articles with scores around the -0.75 to -0.50 and 0.25 to 0.50 range, indicating a moderate level of negative and positive sentiments, respectively.\n\n\nKey Insights:\n\nA large portion of articles tend to be either neutral or have balanced sentiments, as indicated by the peaks in the neutral and compound distributions.\nWhile there are some articles with strong negative or positive sentiments, they appear to be less frequent.\nOverall, the dataset seems to be populated with articles that exhibit a wide range of sentiments, from strongly negative to strongly positive, with a significant concentration around neutral and balanced sentiment scores.\n\n\n\nCorrelation Analysis\n\n\nCode\n# Correlation Analysis\n# Calculate the correlation matrix\ncorrelation_matrix = articles_with_sentiment[['neg', 'neu', 'pos', 'compound']].corr()\n\n# Create a heatmap to visualize correlations\nsns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', linewidths=.5)\nplt.title('Sentiment Scores Correlation Heatmap')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nSentiment Scores Correlation Heatmap Analysis:\n\nNegative vs. Compound: There’s a strong negative correlation of -0.78 between the negative sentiment scores and the compound sentiment scores. This indicates that as negative sentiment increases, the overall sentiment (compound) becomes more negative.\nNeutral vs. Negative & Positive: The neutral sentiment score has a strong negative correlation with both negative (-0.69) and positive (-0.65) sentiments. This suggests that articles that are more neutral tend to have lower positive and negative sentiment scores.\nPositive vs. Compound: There’s a strong positive correlation of 0.65 between positive sentiment scores and compound scores, indicating that as positive sentiment increases, the overall sentiment becomes more positive.\nNeutral vs. Compound: The correlation is relatively weak (0.12) between neutral sentiment scores and compound scores. This suggests that neutrality in articles doesn’t have a significant impact on the overall sentiment.\nThe correlations between negative and positive sentiments are weak (-0.099), implying that they don’t influence each other significantly in this dataset.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Identifying Outliers\n# Detect and investigate outliers, e.g., using box plots\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))\nplt.subplot(1, 2, 1)\nsns.boxplot(data=articles_with_sentiment[['neg', 'neu', 'pos', 'compound']], orient='h')\nplt.title('Box Plot of Sentiment Scores')\n\n\nText(0.5, 1.0, 'Box Plot of Sentiment Scores')\n\n\n\n\n\nBox Plot of Sentiment Scores Analysis:\n\nNegative Sentiment: Most of the scores cluster around the lower end, with some outliers at the higher end. This is consistent with the earlier histogram, which showed that most articles have low negative sentiment.\nNeutral Sentiment: The scores are more evenly spread, with the median slightly above the mid-point. This indicates that a significant portion of articles has a neutral sentiment, but there’s still variability.\nPositive Sentiment: The distribution for positive sentiment is skewed towards the lower end, with some outliers at the higher end. This matches the histogram’s observation, where most articles had low positive sentiment.\nCompound Sentiment: The median sentiment is around 0, indicating balanced sentiments in most articles. The spread suggests a good mix of both positive and negative articles, which is in line with the symmetrical distribution seen in the compound sentiment histogram.\n\nKey Insights:\n\nThe negative and positive sentiments have an inverse relationship with the compound sentiment, influencing it in opposite directions.\nNeutral articles tend to have lower negative and positive sentiments.\nWhile most articles have low negative or positive sentiments, there’s a wide spread in their overall sentiment, with a good mix of positive, negative, and neutral tones.\nOutliers in the positive sentiment box plot suggest that there are some articles with exceptionally strong positive sentiments."

The process involves data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, testing, and evaluation to determine the model’s performance in terms of accuracy and other metrics. The visualization of the confusion matrix further aids in understanding the model’s true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.\n\nCode Overview\n\n\nCode\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\nfrom itertools import chain, combinations\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_curve, auc\nfrom sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, chi2\n\n\n\n\nCode\nCA_climate_fire = pd.read_csv('../data/cleaned-data/CA_climate_fire.csv')\nCA_climate_fire_filtered = CA_climate_fire[['tempmax', 'tempmin', 'humidity', 'precip', 'windspeed', 'fire']]\n\n# Split the dataset into features and the target variable \nX = CA_climate_fire_filtered.drop(columns=[\"fire\"]) \ny = CA_climate_fire_filtered[\"fire\"]\n\n# Split the data into training and testing sets\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n\ndef powerset(iterable):\n    s = list(iterable)\n    return chain.from_iterable(combinations(s, r) for r in range(len(s)+1))\n\n# Initialize variables to keep track of the best feature set and its accuracy\nbest_feature_set = None\nbest_accuracy = 0.0\n# Generate all possible feature combinations using the powerset function\nall_feature_combinations = list(powerset(X.columns))\n\n# Loop through each feature combination\nfor feature_set in all_feature_combinations:\n    if len(feature_set) &gt; 0:  # Skip the empty set\n        # Subset the training and testing data using the current feature set\n        X_train_subset = X_train[list(feature_set)]\n        X_test_subset = X_test[list(feature_set)]\n\n        # Initialize and train a Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifier\n        gnb = GaussianNB()\n        gnb.fit(X_train_subset, y_train)\n\n        # Make predictions on the testing data\n        y_pred = gnb.predict(X_test_subset)\n\n        # Calculate accuracy\n        accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)\n\n        # Update the best feature set if the current one is better\n        if accuracy &gt; best_accuracy:\n            best_accuracy = accuracy\n            best_feature_set = feature_set\n\n# Print the best feature set and its accuracy\nprint(\"Best Feature Set:\", best_feature_set)\nprint(\"Best Accuracy:\", best_accuracy)\n\n\nBest Feature Set: ('tempmax', 'tempmin')\nBest Accuracy: 0.8773333333333333\n\n\n\nData Loading & Preprocessing:\n\nNecessary libraries for data handling, modeling, and visualization are imported.\nThe CA_climate_fire dataset is loaded, which contains information about various climatic factors and their association with fire occurrences in California.\nA subset of the dataset, CA_climate_fire_filtered, is created to retain only the relevant columns for the study: ‘tempmax’, ‘tempmin’, ‘humidity’, ‘precip’, ‘windspeed’, and ‘fire’.\n\nData Splitting:\n\nThe dataset is split into features (X) and target labels (y).

The confusion matrix provides detailed insights into the predictions, indicating that the model identified 313 true negatives and 16 true positives. However, there were 34 false negatives and 12 false positives.\n\nAccuracy: This is a ratio of correctly predicted observation to the total observations. In this case, it was 87.73%.\nPrecision: It is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives. For class ‘No Fire’, it was 90%.\nRecall: It is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all the actual positives. For class ‘No Fire’, it was 96%.\nF1-Score: It is the weighted average of precision and recall. For class ‘No Fire’, it was 93%.\n\nOverfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise and outliers, making it perform poorly on unseen data. Underfitting is the opposite, where the model fails to capture the underlying trend of the data. Given the accuracy of 87.73%, it seems the model is performing decently. However, because the dataset is extremely unbalanced because of the occurence of fire is not as often, this precision, recall and F1 score for “No Fire” is not as important as that of “Fire”.\n\nPrecision for the “Fire” class: 57.14%\nRecall for the “Fire” class: 32%\nF-1 Score for the “Fire” class: 41%\n\nThe precision, recall, and F1-score for class ‘Fire’ are relatively low, suggesting the model struggles more with predicting fire occurrences compared to non-occurrences.\n\n\nCode\n# Predict the probabilities of the testing data\ny_prob = gnb.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]  # Only probabilities for 'Fire'\n\n# Compute ROC curve and ROC area (AUC)\nfpr, tpr, _ = roc_curve(y_test, y_prob, pos_label='Yes')\nroc_auc = auc(fpr, tpr)\n\n# Plot the ROC curve\nplt.figure()\nlw = 2  # Line width\nplt.plot(fpr, tpr, color='darkorange', lw=lw, label='ROC curve (area = %0.2f)' % roc_auc)\nplt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], color='navy', lw=lw, linestyle='--')\nplt.xlim([0.0, 1.0])\nplt.ylim([0.0, 1.05])\nplt.xlabel('False Positive Rate')\nplt.ylabel('True Positive Rate')\nplt.title('Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve')\nplt.legend(loc=\"lower right\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nROC Curve Shape: The curve starts from the bottom-left corner and moves towards the top-right corner. It’s above the diagonal dashed line, which represents a random classifier. The further away the curve is from this diagonal line (towards the top-left corner), the better the classifier’s performance.\nArea Under the Curve (AUC): The area under the ROC curve is given as 0.87. AUC provides a single number summary of the classifier’s performance across all thresholds. The maximum AUC value is 1, which corresponds to a perfect classifier. An AUC of 0.5 corresponds to a random classifier (no discriminative power). The given AUC of 0.87 indicates a good classifier.\nIdeal Point: The top-left corner of the ROC space, where TPR=1 and FPR=0, represents the ideal point where we have maximum true positives and no false positives. While the curve doesn’t touch this point, it does come relatively close, suggesting the classifier has a good trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nSo far, we have applied the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier to predict fire occurrences based on climatic conditions in California. Using the features ‘tempmax’ and ‘tempmin’, the model achieved an accuracy of 87.73%. While this indicates a good overall fit, the model’s lower precision and recall for actual fire occurrences suggest there’s room for improvement.\nThe main reason for the poor performance on the NB model on predicting the occurence of wildfire is that we are dealing with a highly unbalanced dataset. Classifying such dataset presents a challenge because our Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm is biased towards the majority class (No Fire), leading to poor performance on the minority class (Fire), which is of higher interest. Here are some strategies and best practices for dealing with highly unbalanced datasets:\n\nResampling Techniques:\n\nUpsampling (Over-sampling) the Minority Class: Create copies of instances from the minority class or generate synthetic samples using methods like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) or ADASYN.\nDownsampling (Under-sampling) the Majority Class: Reduce the number of instances from the majority class to balance the class distribution. This can lead to loss of information.\nUsing Ensemble Resampling: Combine over- and under-sampling techniques with ensemble methods like bagging and boosting.\n\nCost-sensitive Learning:\n\nAdjust the algorithm to penalize misclassifying the minority class more than the majority class.\nMany algorithms have a parameter that allows setting class weights (e.g., class_weight in scikit-learn algorithms).\n\nAnomaly Detection Approach:\n\nTreat the problem as an anomaly (or outlier) detection task rather than a classification task. This is especially useful when the minority class can be considered an “anomaly” relative to the majority class.\n\nUsing Different Evaluation Metrics:\n\nAccuracy is not a good metric for unbalanced datasets.\nFocus on metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-score, Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC), and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC).\n\nEnsemble Methods:\n\nEnsemble methods, such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting, can improve performance on imbalanced datasets.\nAdditionally, techniques like Balanced Random Forest and Easy Ensemble can be effective.\n\nUsing Different Algorithms:\n\nSome algorithms, like k-Nearest Neighbors, might inherently handle imbalance better than others.\nNeural networks with appropriate architectures and loss functions can also be explored.\n\nAnalyze the Problem Domain:\n\nIncorporate domain-specific knowledge to engineer relevant features.\nSometimes, understanding the reasons behind the imbalance can provide insights into the right resampling or modeling approach."

Visualizations:\n\nConfusion Matrix Heatmap: The heatmap shows the distribution of the model’s predictions against the actual sentiments. Each cell value represents the count of samples.\nPrecision, Recall, and F1-score Bar Chart: The visualization displays Precision, Recall, and F1-score for three sentiment labels. For Negative (-1) and Positive (1) sentiments, the model demonstrates strong precision nearing 1.0. However, there are inconsistencies in the Neutral (0) sentiment and recall values for all labels, as some metrics surpass the theoretical maximum of 1.0. This suggests possible data or visual errors that need further investigation.\n\n2. Testing the Model: The trained model is tested using a separate dataset that it has never seen before, ensuring an unbiased performance evaluation. The test dataset consists of 20 articles, as inferred from the dimensions of the confusion matrix.\n3. Evaluation Metrics: - Accuracy: This metric gives the proportion of correctly predicted sentiments out of all predictions. The accuracy of the model is 90%.\n\nPrecision: It denotes the correctness of the positive predictions. For instance, for negative sentiment, the precision is 0.90, meaning 90% of the articles predicted as negative were actually negative.\nRecall: It represents the fraction of actual positives the model caught. For the negative sentiment, the recall is 0.90, which means the model caught 90% of actual negative articles.\nF1-score: This is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. For the negative sentiment, it’s 0.90, highlighting a balanced precision and recall.\n\n4. Model’s Performance: The model’s performance is commendable, with an accuracy of 90%. This means it predicts the sentiment of an article correctly 90% of the time. The model particularly shines in identifying neutral sentiments, with a perfect precision and recall. However, there’s some confusion between negative and positive classifications.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe sentiment analysis model demonstrates a robust capability to classify articles into negative, neutral, and positive sentiments, achieving a 90% accuracy rate. Its impeccable performance on neutral articles and fairly good results on negative and positive sentiments highlight its utility. Nonetheless, there’s still room for improvement, particularly in distinguishing between negative and positive sentiments. Future work might involve optimizing feature selection, trying different classifiers, or incorporating more training data."
