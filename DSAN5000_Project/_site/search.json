    "text": "Australia Bushfire\nIn 2019/2020, Australia was struck by a severe bushfire, leading to more than 19 million hectares of land burnt, more than 3,000 homes destroyed and 33 people died (Filkov et al. 2020). As a recent study carried out by the University of Maryland, wildfires are currently responsible for an additional 3 million hectares of tree cover loss annually compared to the year 2001. This increase amounts to an area roughly equivalent to the size of Belgium. Remarkably, wildfires have contributed to over a quarter of all tree cover loss observed in the pasttwo decades (Tyukavina et al. 2022). Wildfires are a significant environmental challenge with far-reaching consequences, impacting ecosystems, human lives, and economies. In contrast to other natural hazards like earthquakes or volcanic eruptions, fire is generally seen as a preventable risk. Therefore, predicting and mitigating wildfires is of paramount importance to reduce their devastating effects. This research aims to explore and contribute to the ongoing efforts to better understand wildfire dynamics and improve predictive models for early detection and mitigation."

They lead to ecological damage, air pollution, loss of biodiversity, and economic costs associated with firefighting efforts and property damage. Wildfire smoke, in particular, comprises a blend of dangerous airborne substances, including PM2.5, NO2, ozone, aromatic hydrocarbons, and lead. Beyond polluting the atmosphere with harmful pollutants, wildfires also have a simultaneous effect on the climate by emitting substantial amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the air 1. Reducing the risk of wildfire is crucial for safeguarding our ecosystems, reducing the risk to communities, and managing resources effectively."

    "text": "Previous Researches and Points of Views\nMultiple reports, spanning from mainstream media to peer-reviewed scientific journals, have fostered a prevailing belief that fires have experienced an escalation or intensification on a global scale in recent years. These reports frequently present quantitative findings, yet they frequently rely on limited timeframes and localized datasets concerning fire occurrence or burned areas. Such narrow perspectives may not accurately capture the broader temporal and spatial complexities of the situation. Previous researches have indeed delved into various facets of wildfires, encompassing their origins, patterns, and the creation of predictive models. They reveals diverse perspectives on wildfire prediction and mitigation. Some researchers emphasize the role of climate change2 in exacerbating fire risks, while others focus on the importance of land management practices and early warning systems. There are ongoing debates about the most effective strategies for firefighting and how to balance prevention and response efforts."

However, for my analysis, I need a subset of columns that are relevant. These typically include Year, Northern California, Southern California, and Total. The columns are chosen to focus on the analysis on the trend of wildfire across the states.\n\n\n\nAfter Subsetting\n\n\n\n\nCreate New Column and Remove Unnecessary Columns\nConsolidating Acreage: To simplify the representation of acreage data, I create a new column called California_Acres in the HumanCausedAcres data frame. This new column represents the combined acreage for both Northern and Southern California.\nStreamlining Data: After creating the California_Acres column, I remove the Northern California and Southern California columns from the data frame since they are no longer needed for my analysis.\n\n\n\nRename Columns\nClarity and Consistency: To ensure clarity and consistency in column naming, I rename the ‘Total’ column to ‘Total_Acres’. This change accurately reflects the content of the column, which avoids the mergeing process.\n\nRepeating the above cleaning procedures on the rest of three datasets and get four cleaned up wildfire datasets for this study.\n\n\nMerge Data Frames\nData Integration: I merge two data frames, ‘HumanCausedAcres’ and ‘HumanCausedFires’, using the Year column as the common identifier. Similarly, two other data frames, ‘LighteningAcres’ and ‘LightingFires,’ are also merged based on the Year column. The two merged datasets are called ‘HumanCaused’ and ‘LighteningCaused’ respectively.\n\n\n\n‘HumanCaused’ and ‘LighteningCaused’\n\n\nI observed that the two datasets have the same column names. Because my goal is to conbine the datasets into onw big chart, I need to rename the columns to avoid confusion.\n\n\n\nRenamed ‘HumanCaused’ and ‘LighteningCaused’\n\n\nThen, I can merge the two datasets into one basing on the column Year, and name it ‘Human_Lightening’\n\n\n\n‘Human_Lightening’\n\n\n\n\nSave Cleaned Data\nThe cleaned data is saved into my project repository and can now be used for predictive modeling and other analyses."

    "text": "California Weather Data Statistics\nIn this section, I will outline the data cleaning process for the Cali climate datasets, which include climate data from various years (2020, 2017, 2015, 2014, 2010, and 2001). My goal is to: 1. prepare these datasets for analysis against the SuppCosts dataset on the effects of precipitation on wildfire occurance throughout the years 2. integrate Cali_2020 and Cali_MYD into a combined dataset, Cali20_climate_fire, in order to facilitate the future analysis on climate effects on wildfires in a specific year.\nSince the climate datasets for different years have the same exact data structure, I will use the California climate data in 2020 to demonstrate the cleaning process.\n\nData Loading\nI begin by loading multiple raw datasets, each containing climate data for different years.
